Create Rectangle class with attributes length and breadth and methods to find area and
perimeter. Compare two Rectangle objects by their area.
CODE :
class Rectangle:
 def __init__(self, length, breadth):
 self.length = length
 self.breadth = breadth
 def area(self):
 return self.length * self.breadth
a = int(input("Enter length of rectangle: "))
b = int(input("Enter breadth of rectangle: "))
obj = Rectangle(a, b)
print("Area of rectangle:", obj.area())
